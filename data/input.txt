The advent of artificial intelligence (AI), for instance, is reshaping industries, making processes faster and more efficient. In fields like healthcare, AI is being used to analyze medical data, predict patient outcomes, and even assist in surgeries. Similarly, the rise of 5G networks is opening up new possibilities for faster internet speeds, enabling innovations like smart cities, autonomous vehicles, and the Internet of Things (IoT).
